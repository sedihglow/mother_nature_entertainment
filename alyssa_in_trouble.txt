So, alyssa just got back into her body and brain and is in a bitch black box.

Realease all the people we know from area 51 or whatever fucking place you have
them all boxed. NOW.

My phone is dead, so when you always pretend to call and say hes dark and never
try to contact me any other way...

well my phone is dead. so hit me up on signal.

no door no windows no light. Solitary in a prison maybe? Lost in the system when
they probably just turned themselves in for nothing or got arrested by homeland
security or a cop working for them, then comming to and its pitch black.

yeah it doesnt have to be area 51, but we got boys and girls in there too.
