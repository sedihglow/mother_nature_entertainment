Funny thing is, do i have to post the equations for the multi-verse and explain time relitivity?

I think theres a reason the human yahwehs that are invisible using bulshit god tech think they are gods or something.

i dont think they realize how time works.

1 second in the past?
1 second in the future?
current turn?

check this shit out, diable 1 blizzard entertainment, at a convention on diablo 1 and how
its a turn based game, but blizzard wanted real time, they voted, there was division in the company
over it.

its still turned based but... feels pretty real time.

let me get the link

So this is the video i am about to watch.
This is not the video i learned this from, but it seems to go into more detail than the
convention little stand interview thing that happened a long time ago that i learned this
information about diablo 1 and it being a turn based game originally, and the code did not get changed
or refactored. just some physical settings involving time.
