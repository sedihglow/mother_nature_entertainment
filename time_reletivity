Funny thing is, do i have to post the equations for the multi-verse and explain time relitivity?

I think theres a reason the human yahwehs that are invisible using bulshit god tech think they are gods or something.

i dont think they realize how time works.

1 second in the past?
1 second in the future?
current turn?

check this shit out, diable 1 blizzard entertainment, at a convention on diablo 1 and how
its a turn based game, but blizzard wanted real time, they voted, there was division in the company
over it.

its still turned based but... feels pretty real time.

let me get the link
