its that stupud, they ask these fucking aliens their opinion on abortion and if
they like guns and how they they should or shouldnt like universal healthcare,
then i am sure the aliens and gods and supernatural laugh and say thats
impossible, the universe is too big.


oh yeah another thing in portland, they are doing the crack epidemic move here,
everyone who works for homeland security walks around with cut or primo "clear
and fetty" and they have one person at every buisness in peoples heads saying im
a drug addict or a drug dealer and the biggest threat the human kind by trying
to get a job eat food and hang out and become an engineer.
